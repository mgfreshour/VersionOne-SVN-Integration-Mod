I was working on a project that had several different svn repositories (for 
each model) but a single VersionOne project.  So, I modified the V1 SVN 
integrater to allow for multiple repositories.  While I was at it, I started 
adding other features and decided to make the changes public for all.  The 
original license in license.rtf still holds.
